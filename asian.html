         <h2>General Information</h2>

           <p>
          Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which
          includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as
          well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of
          the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese
          cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications
          made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy
          sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the
          wok, can now be found worldwide.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_food_(disambiguation)"><h4>for more information</h4></a>

        <h2>History</h2>
           <p>
          Chinese society greatly valued gastronomy, and developed an extensive
          study of the subject based on its traditional medical beliefs. Chinese
          culture initially centered around the North China Plain. The first
          domesticated crops seem to have been the foxtail and broomcorn
          varieties of millet, while rice was cultivated in the south. By 2000
          BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. These grains were typically
          served as warm noodle soups instead of baked into bread as in Europe.
          Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed mutton, pork and dog as
          these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and
          flood and meat was preserved with salt, vinegar, curing, and
          fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in
          animal fats though this practice was mostly restricted to the wealthy.

          Noodles Chinese noodles come dry or fresh in a variety of sizes,
          shapes and textures and are often served in soups or fried as
          toppings. Some varieties, such as Shou Mian (寿面, literally noodles
          of longevity), is an avatar of long life and good health according to
          Chinese traditions.[26] Noodles can be served hot or cold with
          different toppings, with broth, and occasionally dry (as is the case
          with mi-fen). Noodles are commonly made with rice flour or wheat
          flour, but other flours such as soybean are also used in minor groups.

          Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop a pinch of salt in the
          water. Place the noodles in the boiling water. Boil the noodles until
          tender. Test to see whether the noodles are done. Remove the noodles
          from heat and drain. Put the noodles in a bowl and add a few drops of
          olive oil. Dress the noodles or use them in a recipe.

          <p>
            Rice is a major staple food for people from rice farming areas in
            southern China.[30] Steamed rice, usually white rice, is the most
            commonly eaten form. People in southern China also like to use rice
            to make congee as breakfast. Rice is also used to produce beer,
            baijiu and vinegars. Glutinous rice ("sticky rice") is a variety of
            rice used in specialty dishes such as lotus leaf rice and glutinous
            rice balls.

          <h3 id="Wheat">Wheat</h3>
            <p>
            In wheat-farming areas in Northern China, people largely rely on
            flour-based food, such as noodles, bing (bread), jiaozi (a kind of
            Chinese dumplings), and mantou (a type of steamed buns)
            </p>
          <h3>Soyabean Products</h3>
            <p>
            Tofu is made of soybeans and is another popular food product that
            supplies protein. The production process of tofu varies from region
            to region, resulting in different kinds of tofu with a wide range of
            texture and taste.[29] Other products such as soy milk, soy paste,
            soy oil, and fermented soy sauce are also important in Chinese
            cooking.

          <h2>Criticism</h2>
            <p>
          The American group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has
          criticized practices in certain parts of the West, Japan and China
          that involve eating live animals and the consumption of exotic game
          and bushmeats as forms of animal cruelty. Examples of eating live
          animals in China include Yin Yang fish (dead-and-alive fish), drunken
          shrimp, and San Zhi Er (baby rodents).[53] Other controversial dishes
          in Chinese cuisine includes Cantonese snake soup, dog meat and bear
          claws.<a href="https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5506-Eating-habits-in-south-China-driving-endangered-animals-to-extinction-"><h4>To read more about eating habits</h4></a>
